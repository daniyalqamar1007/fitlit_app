## üéØ Deployment Steps

### 1. iOS TestFlight Deployment

#### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure you have latest Xcode and Flutter
flutter doctor -v
```

#### Build for iOS
```bash
# Clean previous builds
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Build iOS release
flutter build ios --release

# Or build for iOS device specifically
flutter build ipa --release
```

#### Upload to App Store Connect
1. **Open Xcode**:
   ```bash
   open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **Select Runner** in project navigator

3. **Configure Signing**:
   - Select your team
   - Ensure provisioning profile is set
   - Set bundle identifier to match your App Store Connect app

4. **Archive the App**:
   - Product ‚Üí Archive
   - Wait for archive to complete

5. **Upload to App Store Connect**:
   - Window ‚Üí Organizer
   - Select your archive
   - Click "Distribute App"
   - Choose "App Store Connect"
   - Follow prompts to upload

#### Alternative: Command Line Upload
```bash
# Build IPA
flutter build ipa --release

# Upload using Transporter app or xcrun
xcrun altool --upload-app --type ios -f build/ios/ipa/*.ipa --username [your-email] --password [app-specific-password]
```

### 2. Android Play Console (Optional)

#### Build Android App Bundle
```bash
# Build optimized Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release

# The output will be: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

#### Build APK (if needed)
```bash
# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi

# Output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```
